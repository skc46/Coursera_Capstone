    "Road accident is one of the leading causes of death in many developed as well as in developing countires. According to __Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)__, approximately 1.35 million people are killed each year worldwide on roadways. And, another 50 million people are injured which involves serious damage to their body parts. In addition to causing serious physical damage, the road accidents also cause impact on the traffic; in some cases the accident causes several hours of delay. Long hours of traffic is something that everybody wants to aviod. Hence, reducing the roadways accidents have become an important public safety challenge. While it is not possible to shutdown the whole transportation system to prevent those deaths, since it has direct impact on the economic and social development of any countries. However, the risk can be minimized by taking several preventive actions such as providing more road safety guidelines, improving the road conditions, and imposing new regulations for drivers. In order to take those preventive actions, it is first necessary to understand what is actually causing the problem. Hence the question that we are asking here is \"can we build a model that learns from the historical data and predict the severity of future accidents given the involving the factors?\" From this model, we can learn the impact of different factors on the level of severity. Those factors can be road conditions, weather conditions, daytime, safety status, driving conditions. After we have clear idea of which factor is leading more to severe accidents, we can then lay out several recommendations to minimize those risks. In addition, depending on the severity level, we can also predict how long the traffic is likely to be delayed by that accident. This is very important for those people who are looking to reach to their destination on time. \n",

    "This model would be beneficial to anyone driving in the road at any time. Since, the main goal of this model is to predict the severity of accident and the delays it can cause to the traffic, it can notify others driving through the same road, in the realtime, about the accident and the possibility of delays they might experience ahead. Based on that they can decide whether to proceed in the same road or take an alternate route. As the model will also cover impact of the different weather conditions and driving conditions on the severity of the accident, it would also be useful to giving recommendations to general public to decide whether it is safe to drive given the current situations. \n"

    "#### Understanding the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that we are going to utilize for this project is countrywide car accident dataset, which includes the data collected from February 2016 to June 2020 covering 49 states of the USA. This dataset was extracted from __kaggle__ uploaded by **Sobhan Moosavi**. There are about 3.5 million accident records. This dataset includes many intrinsic and contextual attributes such as location, time, level of severity, time taken to clear the traffic, weather conditions including many other information. The important part of this dataset is that it contains the most recent reports of accidents as well. Since, our main focus is on the severity of the accident, the following features from the dataset are very useful:\n",
    "- __Severity__ (the severity of the accident)\n",
    "- **Start_Time** (the start time of the accident)\n",
    "- **End_Time** (the end time of the accident)\n",
    "- **Distance** (The length of the road extent affected by the accident)\n",
    "\n",
    "The location information is useful to see if the delays are more prolonged in urban areas as compared to rural areas. The following features can be utilized from the dataset:\n",
    "- **City** (the city in address field)\n",
    "- **County** (the county in address field)\n",
    "- **State** (the state in address field)\n",
    "- **Zipcode** (the zipcode in address field)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are also interested in predicting the accident severity based on the weather conditions, following features from the dataset are useful:\n",
    "- **temperature** (the temperature)\n",
    "- **Wind_Chill** (the wind chill)\n",
    "- **Visibility** (visibility in miles)\n",
    "- **Wind_Speed** (wind speed in miles per hour)\n",
    "- **Precipitation** (precipitation amount in inches)\n",
    "- **Weather_condition** (rain, snow, thunderstorm, fog etc.)\n",
    "- **Sunrise_Sunset** (the period of day)"
